Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a new grad looking to break into the tech field, Im interested in backend engineering, and I'm really starting to enjoy creating tools that can be impactful to my daily life while leveraging the open source AI models that are flooding the market. I think its amazing that I can use enterprise level AI models without spending money to train them, and I dont have to sacrifice my own data security when doing so. I love exploring new technologies and I am amazed at the rate that new tools are being released.  Feel free to browse my repositories and connect with me! 


## üöÄ Current Side Projects


**Deploying Fine Tuned LLMs To The Cloud:**  
I am currently working on fine-tuning LLMs with various types of data and deploying them with Azure AI Foundry, Docker, Azure Web Services, and Python (StreamLit) for the UI. This is a project designed to get myself used to the end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline. We will use various MLOps tools to monitor the model after deployment, with the hope of having multiple models available, each fine tuned for a diferent purpose to showcase LLM flexibility.  
  
**Tech Stack:** Azure Blob Storage, Azure AI Foundry, Azure Web Services, Ollama, HuggingFace, Python (Streamlit, Requests, Azure SDK)


## üíº Experience

### üöÄ Software Development Intern, CashOn - San Jose, CA 

*  Contributed to the development of a **robust data pipeline** using **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** to efficiently collect and process home data for tens of thousands of properties via Zillow‚Äôs API.
*  Leveraged **Chrome's caching mechanism** to maintain the state of data collection and processing across application sessions, ensuring seamless data completion upon reopening.
*  Enhanced **data quality** by modifying collection and storage methods to monitor and remove expired data.
*  Designed a user-driven **web scraping** method, enabling efficient collection, processing, and storage of property data via background API requests during normal application use.

### üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Engineering Intern, Meritage Homes - Scottsdale, AZ 

*  Redesigned **SQL data schema**, implemented **data validation checks**, and successfully modified over 30,000 records across 6 tables, ensuring **data integrity** throughout the ETL process.
*  Served as the **primary liaison** with a partner Agile team, providing comprehensive progress reports to the internal team.
*  Implemented a **role-based access management system** for developers and IT personnel, enhancing **security** for production data and developing a strong understanding of **networking fundamentals** with distributed systems.

### üéì Capstone Project: Cloud Based Generative AI SME Azure, Python/Streamlit, LLMs

*  Spearheaded the development of a **custom retrieval augmented generation (RAG) platform** to serve as a **virtual subject matter expert** on a Senior Project sponsored by JPL.
*  Designed and implemented the backend using **Microsoft Azure Cloud Services**.
*  Deployed a custom **GPT-3.5 instance** that queried **Azure AI Search** to retrieve relevant information from **Azure Blob storage**, integrated with a **Python/Streamlit chatbot interface** and a small ADA model for input tokenization.
*  Facilitated **stakeholder engagement** to translate abstract concepts into concrete requirements, fostering a collaborative development process.
*  Utilized **Docker** for containerization, enabling seamless deployment of the platform on **Azure Web Services**.
*  Developed a great foundation in **RAG Systems**. Learning how to deal with: hallucinations, prompt engineering, source citing, tokenization, generating embeddings, API calls to LLMs, and much more.
*  Went from a comlete novice to designing our entire backend architecture utilizing **Microsoft Azure** to handle data storage, model hosting, hosting our app service, and implementing vector stores and AI search for our custom RAG. Learning tons of Azure fundamentals.




## üìö What I'm Learning


*   **React Framework:** React, and other front end frameworks are important to my development as an engineer. Learning a to use a powerful front end tool allows me to go from creating small, technical, academic type "projects", to developing actual applications.
*   **Ollama Local LLMs:** While it's really cool to see all the amazing tools developers are making with AI, I have more fun learning HOW the tools work, seeing behind the curtain, and being able to build tools for MY needs
*   **PostgreSQL:** My Internships have done a great job to introduce me to the world of data collection and storage, however, I have identified some areas of improvement that I want to make so I can more effectively contribute to my future teams.
  
## üéß What I'm Listening To



*   **The AI Podcast - NVIDIA:** Recently, I began listening to the early episodes of "The AI Podcast", made around 2016-2017. I was just beginning my engineering journey when we started to see these major advancements in AI. It is fun to hear about "groundbreaking" developments in CNNs, Deep Learning, Speech Recognition, etc. that feel so commonplace today. 
*   **Software Engineering Daily:** From time to time, this is a great podcast to get in depth explainations of all the latest tech news. It feels like a new AI tool, model, or training method drops every day, this helps separate the hype from the news.
*   **The TB 12 Method - Tom Brady:** I have become super interested in "the power of the mind" and what we can acomplish when we stop imposing mental barriers on ourselves. This is a great mental-tool that helps me relax my brain when I want to step away from code.
